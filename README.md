# MURI-HASP_Thermal-Vac
Summer People,
Make sure to transfer everything over to the teensy as quickly
as possible for the best form factor and increased performance, 
as well as future compatibility. As soon as everything is on the
Teensy 3.5/3.6 board and working, construct a simple PCB (Printed
Circuit Board) to mount it on for best performance and ease of 
use. Future iterations of the PCB will expand upon these 
capabilities as needed and the board will continue to evolve,
if necessary. More information on other plans for thermal-vac
expansion are going to be given to Dr. Flaten and also posted
on the team drive.
